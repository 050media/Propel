<p>Hi there, my name is William Durand&nbsp;and, Fran&ccedil;ois introduced me&nbsp;<a href="http://propel.posterous.com/propel-has-a-new-leader">in the previous post</a>. He said a lot of positive points about me and I'm glad to hear that from him.</p>
<p>Let me introduce myself a&nbsp;bit more, I'm&nbsp;currently&nbsp;working with Fran&ccedil;ois at e-TF1&nbsp;and&nbsp;while I'm mainly focused&nbsp;on&nbsp;symfony2&nbsp;developments&nbsp;using&nbsp;Propel&nbsp;and I can assure you it works well !</p>
<p>A month ago, some people asked&nbsp;if I'd become the new Propel lead developer and my answer was quite clear :&nbsp;very unlikely. Fran&ccedil;ois did a huge work on Propel, thanks for that&nbsp;but it makes it even harder&nbsp;to&nbsp;take over.</p>
<p>I though a lot before&nbsp;asking&nbsp;him the keys and I&nbsp;would&nbsp;probably never asked&nbsp;him without the trust of two&nbsp;guys :&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/themouette">Julien Muetton</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/themouette">@themouette</a>) and <a href="https://github.com/mazenovi">Vincent Mazenod</a>&nbsp;(<a href="https://twitter.com/mazenovi">@mazenovi</a>) who were&nbsp;sharing my feeling :&nbsp;<strong>Propel&nbsp;can't&nbsp;die</strong>.<!--more--></p>
<div>
<p>Open source is about involving people together to build awesome things, that's why I'm proud to announce that Julien, Vincent and I are what we can call "<strong>the new Propel core team</strong>".</p>
</div>
<p>From now on, the Propel project is not just the <strong>Propel ORM</strong>, it's also the <strong>sfPropel15Plugin </strong>plugin for symfony 1.x and the <strong>PropelBundle </strong>bundle for Symfony2&nbsp;&nbsp;and we are&nbsp;three developers to improve these three projects.</p>
<p>We've known each other for a&nbsp;long time and we share the same philosophy about how to improve Propel. Our main goal is to provide a <em>better integration of Propel with Symfony2</em> in order to propose a real alternative to&nbsp;Doctrine2. <em>More&nbsp;points</em> will be presented <em>in the next weeks</em> on this blog. We are walking in the same direction in order to keep Propel on the state of the art.</p>
<div>
<p>By the way, a major change just appeared. The plain old <em>SVN repository is frozen as well as the TRAC system</em>,&nbsp;you should now look at the <strong>Github organization</strong> :&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/propelorm" target="_blank">https://github.com/propelorm</a>. We are now using <strong>Git </strong>as the main Version Control System and you will find the following projects :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel">Propel</a>&nbsp;</strong>1.6 which became the new foundation for Propel ORM ;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/propelorm/sfPropel15Plugin">sfPropel15Plugin</a>&nbsp;</strong>: the symfony 1.x plugin ;</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/propelorm/PropelBundle">PropelBundle</a> </strong>: the Symfony2 bundle.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><em>New issues will have to be reported&nbsp;in&nbsp;through&nbsp;Github</em>, in the appropriate&nbsp;repository. Old tickets will be&nbsp;reviewed but if you expect&nbsp;us to&nbsp;work on your problem,&nbsp;<em>you are encouraged to duplicate your issue in Github tracker</em>. We also expect a lot of Pull Requests from you and we will happily to merge them. And please, don't forget unit tests ;)</p>
<p>The last words will be for Fran&ccedil;ois, you made an amazing work on Propel and&nbsp;working&nbsp;day by day with you is always a pleasure.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing ! We'll organize a meetup in september so stay tuned :)</p>
<p><em>Propel is really back !</em></p>
