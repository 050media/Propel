<p>Yes, I know... Here are the last news related to Propel:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Propel 1.6</span></p>
<p>The Propel 1.6.x branch is always quite active and we merge bug fixes frequently. Propel 1.6 is now available through <a href="https://github.com/composer/composer">Composer</a>:&nbsp;<a href="http://packagist.org/packages/propel/propel1">propel/propel1</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Propel2</span></p>
<p>The activity of <strong>Propel2</strong> is really active and tons of RFCs are written and discussed. You should come and discuss&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/issues?sort=updated&amp;direction=desc&amp;state=open">Propel2 issues</a>. And, any help is welcomed. You'll find Propel2 on Packagist too: <a href="http://packagist.org/packages/propel/propel">propel/propel</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">symfony 1.x</span></p>
<p>You'll find a new <strong>sfPropelORMPlugin</strong> version available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfPropelORMPlugin">symfony-project.org</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/sfPropelORMPlugin/tags">GitHub</a>. It contains minor fixes and embeds Propel 1.6.3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Symfony2</span></p>
<p>Propel is now part of Symfony2 with the recent merge of a&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/d59bde758541f64ca2df555eb996eee1f85d49eb">Propel Bridge</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/PropelBundle">PropelBundle</a> has been updated to use this bridge. That means the PropelBundle's <strong>master</strong> branch is compatible with Symfony2 <strong>master</strong> only (and with the upcoming <strong>2.1</strong>&nbsp;version). If you want to use the PropelBundle with Symfony2 version 2.x.x, you'll find a <strong>2.0</strong> branch.</p>
<p>More and more bundles are Propel compliant like the <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSUserBundle">FOSUserBundle</a>&nbsp;and a work on the Symfony2 documentation will be done to write agnostic bundles compatible with both Doctrine2 and Propel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long life to Propel :)</p>
