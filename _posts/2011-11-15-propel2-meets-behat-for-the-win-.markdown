<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Do you know <a href="http://behat.org/"><strong>Behat</strong></a> ? It's a&nbsp;<strong>B</strong>ehavior <strong>D</strong>riven <strong>D</strong>evelopment (BDD) Framework inspired by Ruby's Cucumber project, originally written by Konstantin&nbsp;Kudryashov&nbsp;aka <a href="https://twitter.com/everzet">@everzet</a>. The aim of this library is to provide&nbsp;<strong>functional tests</strong> to your application.</p>
<p>You'll probably ask me why I'm talking about Behat on the Propel's blog, and you are right. Yesterday, I received an incredible email from Konstantin and some of <a href="https://twitter.com/xosofox/status/136213138650566656">you asked us what was the subject</a>. Actually, Konstantin and the KnpLabs' team want to offer a gift to you, Propel community, by taking part in the Propel2 development! That's really fantastic!<!--more--> They'll bring&nbsp;<strong>Behat</strong> and <strong>BDD</strong> to the&nbsp;Propel2 development process, for instance:</p>

<p>So, please welcome Konstantin and Behat to the <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2">Propel2</a> project!</p>
