<p>The Propel documentation available at <a href="http://www.propelorm.org">www.propelorm.org</a> is down for some obscure reasons. We are working with GitHub to find a solution and to fix this major issue.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the <strong>documentation is available at</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="http://jaugustin.github.com/">http://jaugustin.github.com/</a>. This mirror is up to date.</p>
