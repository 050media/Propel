<p>One line can do a lot of things...</p>

<p>sfPropel15Plugin features two new tools, sfFormPropel::embedRelation(), and sfFormPropel::mergeRelation(). These will be great time-savers, as they allow you to add, edit, and remove related objects in the same form as the main object.</p>
<p>This feature is already available, and fully documented at <a href="http://trac.symfony-project.org/browser/plugins/sfPropel15Plugin/trunk/doc/form.txt">http://trac.symfony-project.org/browser/plugins/sfPropel15Plugin/trunk/doc/fo...</a></p>
