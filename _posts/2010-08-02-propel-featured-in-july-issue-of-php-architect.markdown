published: true

<p>If you're a regular reader of <a href="http://www.phparch.com/">the php|architect magazine</a>, you've probably already read it. Today, in its&nbsp;<a href="http://www.phparch.com/magazine/2010/july/">July issue</a>, the PHP magazine published an article about Propel that I wrote a few months ago. Titled "Good Old Propel", it's a general presentation of Propel and the new features introduced by Propel 1.5.</p>
<p>If you happen to write an article about Propel that gets published in any PHP magazine, don't hesitate to send us a notice: we will advertise it in this very blog.</p>
