MySQL is in danger. It&#39;s Monthy, the very creator of MySQL, and currently lead developer of MariaDB, who says it:<p /><a href="http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/12/help-saving-mysql.html">http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2009/12/help-saving-mysql.html</a><p /> Propel wouldn&#39;t be what it is today without MySQL. The same goes for a lot of open-source projects out there. With MySQL in jeopardy, the whole web development activity could suffer serious damage.<p />If MySQL and the idea of Open-Source matter to you, I suggest you that relay this information in your blog / twitter / company. You an also write to the EC commission, as I did myself.
