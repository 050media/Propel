<p>Propel 1.6, the next iteration of the PHP ORM, is still under heavy development. But since it&rsquo;s backwards compatible with previous versions, you can easily test it on an existing application. One good reason to try it on is to take advantage of <a href="http://www.propelorm.org/wiki/Documentation/1.6/WhatsNew#XMLYAMLJSONCSVParsingandDumping">the new ability of ActiveRecord and Query classes to be dumped to a YAML string</a>.</p>
<p>And if you combine this ability with the power of <a href="http://www.phpsh.org/">phpsh</a> - an interactive PHP shell utility which is to PHP what IRB is to Ruby - you&rsquo;ve got a new way to interact with your domain model.&nbsp;Just feed phpsh with a bootstrap script that initializes Propel and autoload your model classes, and you're good to go. Check the following screencast for an example:</p>

<p>ActiveRecord and Query classes can also be dumped to XML, JSON, and CSV. You can visualize joined hydration. And you can use your custom filters, too!</p>
<p>No need to write a custom script to check the persisted objects of your domain model anymore. Combined with phpsh, Propel now almost feels like object-oriented database.</p>
