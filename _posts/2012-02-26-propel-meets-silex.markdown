<p>Do you know <a href="http://silex.sensiolabs.org/">Silex</a>, the awesome PHP micro-framework? It's based on the Symfony2 components, and provides all you need to write applications.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/cristianoc72">Cristiano Cinotti</a>, we now have an official <strong><a href="https://github.com/propelorm/PropelServiceProvider">Propel Service Provider</a></strong> for <strong>Silex</strong> that eases the integration of Propel in a Silex based application. You'll find this project on our <a href="https://github.com/propelorm">GitHub organization</a>, so don't hesitate to contribute.</p>
<p>One more thing,&nbsp;to show how the provider works, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/willdurand/Propilex">Propilex</a>, a simple application to manage documents, with a generic&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/willdurand/Propilex/blob/master/src/Propilex/Provider/RestController.php">RESTful controller</a>, and Backbone.</p>
