title: Discover Propel2 at Symfony Live 2012
published: true
---
<p>I will present <a href="http://github.com/propelorm/Propel2">Propel2</a> for the first time at <a href="http://paris2012.live.symfony.com/">Symfony Live 2012</a>, this friday in Paris. Even if Propel2 is not yet released, the major work has been done.</p>
<p>If you don't know Propel, you should come. If you know Propel 1.6, you should come. And, if you already know Propel2, you should come too because I have interesting news to share with everybody.</p>
