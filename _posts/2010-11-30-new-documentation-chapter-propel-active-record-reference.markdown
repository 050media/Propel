title: ! 'New Documentation Chapter: Propel Active Record reference'
published: true
---
<p>Lots of details about the Propel Active Record objects used to be scattered among the multiple chapters of the Propel documentation. Since yesterday, the Propel 1.6 documentation has a new reference chapter: the <a href="http://www.propelorm.org/wiki/Documentation/1.6/ActiveRecord">Active Record reference</a>.</p>
<p>If you're a long time Propel user, and if you know your generated Active Record classes by heart, you may not learn much there - although Propel has many lesser known features&nbsp;buried in the BaseObject class&nbsp;that can be of great help. On the other hand, if you're discovering Propel, or if you are interested in the upcoming Propel 1.6 runtime features, head to this new piece of documentation for a complete list of features of one of the main central elements of the Propel runtime API.</p>
