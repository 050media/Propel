<div>Hi there,</div>
<p />
<div>
<div>I'm glad to&nbsp;announce&nbsp;a good news for symfony 1.x users. As you may know, the whole Propel project has moved to the <a href="https://github.com/propelorm">PropelORM organization</a>&nbsp;on Github&nbsp;and you'll find the <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel">Propel</a> project, the <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/PropelBundle">PropelBundle</a> for Symfony2 and the <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/sfPropelORMPlugin">sfPropel15Plugin</a> for symfony 1.x.</div>
<p />
<div>But, wait ? You said "sfPropel15Plugin" while the last Propel version is 1.6.1 ?! Agreed, it does not make sense. That's why, a few weeks ago <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/sfPropelORMPlugin/issues/51">I proposed to rename this plugin</a>. Thanks to Fran&ccedil;ois, we found a lovely name : <strong>sfPropelORMPlugin</strong>.</div>
<p />
</div>
<div>I started to work on it and thanks to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/themouette">Julien</a> who did a great work to fix all tests, we can proudly announce the release of this plugin:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/propelorm/sfPropelORMPlugin">https://github.com/propelorm/sfPropelORMPlugin</a>.</div>
<div>Basically, it provides the same features but it's designed to work fine with both SVN and Git through Github. I let you read the README to learn how to deal with it.&nbsp;Upgrade is really easy, you just have to install&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/propelorm/sfPropelORMPlugin">sfPropelORMPlugin</a>&nbsp;as a new plugin and migrate your behaviors registration in propel.ini.</div>
<p />
<div>As usual, feel free to fork the plugin and to participate by reporting issues or send pull requests.&nbsp;Oh, and expect more news on this blog soon !</div>
