title: Symfony 1.3 and 1.4 released with Propel support
published: true
---
<p>The symfony framework just announced a major step in its history: the <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/blog/2009/12/01/symfony-1-3-and-1-4-stable-released">dual release of the 1.3 and 1.4 versions</a>. Both these versions embed Propel 1.4 so you can start building web applications faster with your favorite ORM.<p /> Symfony is, simply said, the best PHP framework out there. And I don't write that because I'm a former member of the symfony team - the competitors can't compare in terms of robustness, design, features, coherence, ease of use, and integration into a professional workflow of web development. The work on the 1.3 and 1.4 versions of the framework is astounding, making symfony better in every possible way. Congratulations to the symfony core team and to all the contributors of the framework for this great job. It's a great day for symfony.<p /> It's also a great day for Propel, for the developers and the users community. Propel will get more exposure thanks to symfony, and the new users and volunteers will keep on enhancing it more and more every day.</p>
