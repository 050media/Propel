<p>Yesterday, I had the pleasure to introduce Propel to a panel of French developers invited by <a href="http://www.afup.org/">AFUP</a>, the French PHP User Group.</p>
<p>Here are the slides of the presentation.</p>

<p>The conference ended with a debate with developers comparing the merits of Propel, Doctrine, home-made ORMs and raw NoSQL. It was also a great opportunity to meet in real life people that I know online from the Propel mailing-lists, twitter, or my past life with symfony. Thanks to AFUP for organizing this event!</p>
