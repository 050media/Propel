title: Propel2 IRC Meeting next Monday
published: true
---
<p>Six months ago, I wrote a blog post titled&nbsp;<a href="http://propel.posterous.com/propel2-has-begun">Propel2 has begun!</a>, now it's time to speak about its release. Yes, no mistake there, Propel2 is almost ready, and we would love to talk with you.</p>
<p>That's why we&nbsp;will organize an IRC meeting on Monday, April 23 at 21:00&nbsp;CEST&nbsp;(+02:00 - that's Paris/Zurich time) focused on <strong>Propel2</strong>.</p>
<p>The IRC meeting will be on the&nbsp;<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=propel">#propel</a>&nbsp;channel on the Freenode IRC server.</p>
<p>See you on Monday!</p>
