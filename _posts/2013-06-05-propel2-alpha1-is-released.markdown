A couple weeks ago, we announced that [Propel was about to be
released]({% post_url 2013-05-13-propel2-is-about-to-be-released %}),
and today is a special day for the Propel community. We are glad to inform you
that **Propel2 alpha1** is now **available**!

<!-- more -->

You will find the code for this first `alpha` version here on GitHub:
[2.0.0-alpha1](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/tree/2.0.0-alpha1).
The [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) package is `propel/propel`, and the first
version is already available through
[Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/propel/propel).

```json
{
    "propel/propel": "2.0.0-alpha1"
}
```

The [documentation](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/pull/316) is not
entirely up to date, and we decided to postpone this issue for next release,
scheduled for the first week of July (next month).

Talking about the next releases, the
[alpha2](https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/issues?milestone=3&state=open)
version is our next milestone. We plan to release a few _alpha_ versions, as
soon as possible ("release early, release often" they said).

Note that the [PropelBundle](http://github.com/propelorm/PropelBundle) does not
support Propel2 yet.

Thank you to all contributors, and now, let's celebrate!
