title: sfPropel16Plugin Is Already There, Didn't You Know?
published: true
---
The question arose several times in the past weeks: When will sfPropel16Plugin be published? Well, it&#39;s been published for a long time already, it&#39;s just that it was called &quot;sfPropel15Plugin/1.6 branch&quot;. You can find it on GitHub: <p /><div><a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/sfPropel15Plugin">https://github.com/fzaninotto/sfPropel15Plugin</a></div><p /><div>This repository used to default to the &#39;master&#39; branch, which is a clone of t<a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfPropel15Plugin">he current 1.5 branch of sfPropel15Plugin</a>. Enhancements were added to the 1.6 branch, which recently became the default branch. </div> <p /><div>The repository contains an &#39;INSTALL&#39; file explaining the few steps to get the plugin running on a symfony 1.4 project. </div><p /><div>Compared to the 1.5 version, this plugin features new tasks to deal with migrations: `diff`, `migrate`, `up`, and `down`. Use the `symfony help` command to get usage information on these tasks, and refer to the Propel documentation for a <a href="http://www.propelorm.org/wiki/Documentation/1.6/Migrations">complete explanation of Propel migrations</a>. There is also support for master-slave configuration right in the `databases.yml`, the ability to filter embedded forms with a `Criteria`, and <a href="https://github.com/fzaninotto/sfPropel15Plugin/commits/1.6">several bug fixes</a>.</div> <p /><div>It&#39;s a drop-in replacement for the previous sfPropel15Plugin from the symfony plugins page.</div><p /><div>Last question: Why is it called sfPropel15Plugin if it embeds Propel 1.6? Because we won&#39;t force you to use different class names for each minor release of Propel. Backwards compatibility has always been a central concern, and changing the plugin name (and the names of the classes it embeds) wouldn&#39;t allow that. That wouldn&#39;t be so surprising if Propel 1.5 was named Propel 2, except that wasn&#39;t the case ;)</div>
