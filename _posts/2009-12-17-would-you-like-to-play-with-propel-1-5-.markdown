title: Would You Like To Play With Propel 1.5?
published: true

The release date of Propel 1.5 is <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/milestone/1.5">a couple months ahead</a>, but since this new version offers only backwards compatible enhancements, you can play with it in your existing applications, or start developing new applications with it, right now. <p /> The 1.5 branch is very stable, and passes all the 928 unit tests of Propel 1.4 - plus 891 new tests added just for the 1.5 additional features. That&#39;s right, Propel 1.5 has nearly doubled the total number of unit tests from Propel 1.4 ; and if you remember correctly, Propel 1.4 already had twice as many unit tests as Propel 1.3.<p /> There are three killer features in Propel 1.5 that you may want to use right away:<p /> - <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/wiki/Users/Documentation/1.5/ModelCriteria">New Query API</a><br /> - <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/wiki/Users/Documentation/1.5/Behaviors/nested_set">Nested set behavior</a><br />  - <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/wiki/Users/Documentation/1.5/Behaviors/sortable">Sortable behavior</a><p />Propel 1.5 doesn&#39;t offer a PEAR package for now, but a Subversion checkout will do the trick:<p />   &gt; svn checkout <a href="http://svn.phpdb.org/propel/branches/1.5">http://svn.phpdb.org/propel/branches/1.5</a> <p />Alternatively, symfony users can benefit from the brand new <a href="http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfPropel15Plugin">sfPropel15Plugin</a>, which is a drop-in replacement for the core sfPropelPlugin in applications using symfony 1.3 or 1.4.<p /> Feedback is welcome on the stability and usability of the new features. As always, the <a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/">Propel Trac ticketing</a> is your best friend to mention bugs or request features.
