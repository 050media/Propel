<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I'm glad to announce that <strong>Propel2</strong> is on <strong>GitHub</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2">https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2</a>. You'll find the <strong>Roadmap</strong> in the issues section:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/issues/1">https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/issues/1</a>.</p>
<p>Everyone can contribute to Propel2, and we hope to release a first stable version within a month.</p>
