<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>As I said previously, we will organize an IRC meeting on Wednesday October 5th at&nbsp;17:00 CET (+01:00 - that's Paris time). We will talk about the future of Propel, and we will introduce&nbsp;<strong>Propel2</strong>.&nbsp;Yes! You read that well ; we have plenty ideas to discuss : PSR-0 autoloader, refactoring of builders using Twig, improvement of the whole code and so on!</p>
<p>The IRC meeting will be on the&nbsp;<a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=propel">#propel</a>&nbsp;channel on the Freenode IRC server.</p>
<p>See you on Wednesday&nbsp;!</p>
