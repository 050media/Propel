Don't hesitate to subscribe to the blog <a href="http://propel.posterous.com/rss.xml">RSS feed</a>, we'll not spam you. And don't hesitate to comment, we'll listen to you.</div>
<p />
<div>Note that Propel used to have some sort of blog in the past - only it was in the&nbsp;<a href="http://propel.phpdb.org/trac/wiki/Users/News">Propel Trac</a>. You will still find there all the old posts related to Propel 1.3 and previous versions.</div>
