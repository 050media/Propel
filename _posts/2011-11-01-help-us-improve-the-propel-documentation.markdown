title: Help Us Improve The Propel Documentation
published: true
---
<p>The Propel documentation available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.propelorm.org/">http://www.propelorm.org/</a>&nbsp;is hosted on GitHub. It runs with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a powerful static site generator. It allows us to manage the documentation as a real project. You'll find the repository here:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/propelorm/propelorm.github.com">https://github.com/propelorm/propelorm.github.com</a>.</p>
<p>The documentation is one of the Propel's strenghts, that's why we have to improve it all the time. To ease the process, we've added a <strong>fork &amp; edit</strong>&nbsp;link to quickly fix typos or more substantial errors:</p>

<p>By clicking on this link, you'll get a fantastic editor which allows you to fix the doc, and to submit a new Pull Request. As you can see, it's really easy!</p>
<p>[[posterous-content:xmfweEkHHchmaiyIgFze]]Thanks to GitHub, updating the Propel documentation is really easy and really fast, you just need a GitHub account. And, to be honest, <a href="https://twitter.com/francoisz/status/67485227794169856">who doesn't have an account yet</a> ?</p>
<p>You're all welcome to contribute to the documentation. Oh! And, there is also a <a href="http://www.propelorm.org/documentation/#cookbook">Cookbook</a> section in which you can&nbsp;write your favorite recipe.</p>
