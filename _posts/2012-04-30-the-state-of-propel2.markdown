title: The State Of Propel2
published: true
---
<p>A week ago, we held the second Propel2 IRC Meeting to talk about Propel2. It was really interesting, and constructive.</p>
<p>First, we talked about the roadmap. We asked people to delay the Twig/Builders refactoring. Some concepts we use today are not easily doable using Twig (filters for instance). In other words, we have to think a bit more on this part, and to build a proof of concept with Twig. Last thing on this point,&nbsp;we tagged <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2/issues?direction=desc&amp;labels=Pre-Release+Blocker&amp;milestone=&amp;page=1&amp;sort=updated&amp;state=open">all blocking issues for a pre release</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">The second main topic was the documentation with a call for a leader, and contributors. We also decided to write a tutorial to introduce Propel2 in real life.</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s3">The third point was Propel</span> 1.6, and Propel2 in the [s|S]ymfony world. The consensus is that&nbsp;symfony 1.x won't officially support Propel2. By the way, Propel 1.6 is still bug/security fixes only, and no plan to stop it. For Symfony2, the PropelBundle follows a <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/PropelBundle/wiki">new branching model</a> to prepare the Propel2's integration.</p>
<p class="p2">One more thing, we will have Behat tests in the first Propel2 release thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/everzet">@everzet</a>!</p>
