<p><em>Propel comes with a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.propelorm.org/documentation/#behaviors_reference">large set of behaviors</a>&nbsp;but most of them are already well-known. However, we noticed that a lot of people didn't know about the awesome user contributions we have in the Propel community.&nbsp;</em><em>In this series, we will introduce a new user contributed Propel behavior each week.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/willdurand/GeocodableBehavior">GeocodableBehavior</a>&nbsp;helps you build geo-aware applications by providing geocoding features to your ActiveRecord objects. It's also a wrapper for the powerful&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/willdurand/Geocoder">Geocoder</a>&nbsp;library designed to solve geocoding problematics in PHP.<!--more--></p>
<p>The GeocodableBehavior provides new methods to both the <strong>ActiveRecord</strong> and the <strong>ActiveQuery</strong> APIs, and it works fine without Geocoder. Basically, adding this behavior to your XML schema will:</p>
<ul>
<li>add <strong>two new columns</strong> to your model: <code>latitude</code> and <code>longitude;</code></li>
<li>add <strong>four new methods to the ActiveRecord API</strong>: <code>getDistanceTo()</code>, <code>isGeocoded()</code>, <code>getCoordinates()</code>, and <code>setCoordinates()</code>;</li>
<li>add <strong>two new methods to the ActiveQuery API</strong>: <code>filterByDistanceFrom()</code>, <code>filterNear()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>getDistanceTo()</code> method&nbsp;returns the distance between the current object and a given one. You can specify the measure unit: <code>KILOMETERS_UNIT</code>,<code>MILES_UNIT</code>, or <code>NAUTICAL_MILES_UNIT</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>filterByDistanceFrom()</code> method&nbsp;adds a filter by distance on your current query and returns itself for fluid interface. This method is useful when you want to get results around a given position. The <code>filterNear()</code> is pretty much the same but takes a geocoded object instead of a position.</p>

<p>Then again, you get these methods for free, you just have to install the behavior and that's it. But this behavior is also a wrapper for the Geocoder library, so it does a lot more like <strong>automatic geocoding</strong>. There are two strategies: <strong>IP-address based</strong>, or <strong>Street-address based</strong>. The behavior guesses useful columns in your table in order to perform geocoding requests.&nbsp;Basically, the behavior looks for attributes called street, locality, region, postal code/zip code, and country. It tries to make a complete address with them. As usual, you can add your own list of attributes that represents a complete street address thanks to the <code>address_columns</code> parameter.</p>
<p>By using Geocoder and the automatic geocoding feature, a new method will be available in the ActiveRecord API:&nbsp;<code>geocode()</code>.&nbsp;This method will be triggered on save or update, but you can disable the autofill on update thanks to the&nbsp;<code>auto_update</code>&nbsp;parameter.&nbsp;For more information, read <a href="https://github.com/willdurand/GeocodableBehavior#automatic-geocoding">the documentation about automatic geocoding</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://williamdurand.fr/2012/05/31/geocoder-the-missing-php5-library/">this blog post about Geocoder</a>.</p>
<p>This behavior is highly configurable and here is the reference configuration:</p>
<p><script src="https://gist.github.com/500a1c6bd6fb3875145d.js"></script></p>
<p>As you can see, you can configure Geocoder to fit your needs without any effort.&nbsp;This behavior is really flexible, and works with Propel 1.6.4 or higher.&nbsp;It is fully unit tested, and hosted on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/willdurand/GeocodableBehavior">willdurand/GeocodableBehavior</a>. The Geocoder library is also hosted on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/willdurand/Geocoder">willdurand/Geocoder</a>.</p>
