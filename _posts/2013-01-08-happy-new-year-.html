<p>We wish you a happy new year and all the best for 2013!</p>
<p>Quick news:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel">Propel</a> 1.6.8 will be released soon, and includes a lot of fixes and some new light-weight features. As you may noticed, the number of new versions is decreasing in order to freeze all new developments on this project.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/propelorm/Propel2">Propel2</a> is not under heavy development right now, but we are close to the end, and we have new plans to make it awesome!</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/sfPropelORMPlugin">sfPropelORMPlugin</a>&nbsp;is not actively maintained, mostly due to the symfony 1.x end of life.</li>
<li>The Symfony2 <a href="https://github.com/propelorm/PropelBundle">PropelBundle</a>&nbsp;is on its way, and everything seems ok.</li>
<li>We are discussing the need for a <a href="http://framework.zend.com/">Zend Framework 2</a> Module to integrate Propel in ZF. No decision has been made though. If you want to follow this discussion, subscribe to <a href="http://propelorm.org/support.html">the Propel Mailing-List</a>.</li>
</ul>
