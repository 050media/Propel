title: The Propel Website Gets a Better Search
published: true
---
The Propel pages now offer a search box capable of searching terms in the whole Propel site, including the blog and the documentation for later versions (1.4 to 1.6).<p /><div>Courtesy of <a href="http://www.google.com/cse">Google Custom search</a>, this basic feature improves the previous search engine provided by Trac (and still available at <a href="http://www.propelorm.org/search">http://www.propelorm.org/search</a>), which wasn&#39;t able to search in wiki pages embedding content from the SVN repository (that&#39;s the case of the 1.4 to 1.6 documentation pages), or in other domains (that&#39;s the case of the Propel blog). The Trac search engine often failed to return relevant results on terms like &quot;migrations&quot; and &quot;enum&quot;, even if those features are fully documented already.</div> <p /><div>It&#39;s not a big deal, but it should make your life easier.</div>
